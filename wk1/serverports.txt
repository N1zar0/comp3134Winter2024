Definition of Server Port:
Web server ports are the logical endpoints of a network connection that is used to exchange information between a web server and a web client. These ports are assigned a unique number to identify them separately

Server Port Range:
The server port range refers to the range of port numbers available for use by various services or applications on a server. In the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) system, ports are divided into three ranges: well-known ports (0-1023), registered ports (1024-49151), and dynamic or private ports (49152-65535). The well-known ports are typically reserved for widely used services and applications.

Number of Bits Representing Server Port Range:
The server port range is represented by 16 bits, as the port numbers are 16-bit unsigned integers. This means there are a total of 2^16 (or 65,536) possible port numbers in the entire range.

10 Common Server Ports:

HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): Port 80
